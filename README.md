The analysis of transaction's impact on Total Shareholder's Return (TSR). This study examined whether deals created sustainable shareholder value.

<h3>Hypothesis Tested:</h3>

Is there any relation between frequency of M&A activities?

Is there any relations between relative size of target and acquirer?

Is there any relations between divestiture and overall performance?

Company Performance comparing:

Companies growing through acquisitions relative to those growing purely through organic strategies 

Acquirers targeting large vs small businesses (relative to their size)

Periodic acquirers vs consistent acquirers 

Local vs offshore acquirers 

Industry only vs cross-industry

YoY growth rates in revenues vs YoY growth rates inÂ costs, for most frequent acquirers vs non acquirers

Level of contestability of the transaction (shareholder pushback, media coverage)
